# Data-Analysis-of-Properties

The task evolved around the gathering of data, preprocessing it, and apply statistical as well as visual analytics techniques to derive meaning and build story fromt the data.

The data was scraped from a real estate website based in New York, USA. The following link was used as a reference:https://github.com/maksimKorzh/one-time-scrapers/blob/master/scrapers/zillow/zillow_scraper.py

The data later was preprocessed and finally Exploratory Data Analysis was performed using various statistical methods and visualisations with the help of python libraries Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

The python file contains the code for the same and the CSV file consists of the data gathered after Web Scraping. 

NOTE: The analysis was done as a part of the assessment in the SDPA (Software Development and Programming Analysis) module in the degree MSc Data Science at the University of Bristol, UK.
